# camfowler's minimal Vim

The focus is on a powerful environment, without replacing any core functionality of Vim itself. For example, autocomplete in Vim is baked in and it is great. There is no need to add a package for it!

If you think this config is missing something, have a good search over the built-in tools available in Vim - you may be surprised!

These simple commands will get you vimming in no time:

```sh
# Clone this repo
git clone --recurse-submodules --jobs 8 https://github.com/camfowler/vim.git ~/.vim
```

After a while, those submodules might need updating.

```
git pull --recurse-submodules --jobs 8
```

Enjoy!
